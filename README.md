## Introduction
Hello, I'm Jaeun Shin! I'm an aspiring engineer with a passion for machine learning, currently preparing to matriculate at Trinity College, University of Cambridge for Engineering. My journey into the world of tech is just beginning, and I'm eager to explore the vast possibilities that machine learning and data science offer.

## Interests
My main interest lies in **Machine Learning**. I'm fascinated by the ability of algorithms to learn from and make predictions on data, and I'm committed to diving deep into this field. I believe in the power of machine learning to transform industries and improve lives, and I'm excited to be part of that change.

## Current Learning
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**: I'm currently strengthening my foundation in computer science by learning about various data structures and algorithms. Understanding these core concepts is crucial for solving complex problems efficiently.
- **Machine Learning**: I've taken a few online courses to bolster my understanding of machine learning, including the renowned course by Andrew Ng on Coursera. These courses have provided me with a solid groundwork in machine learning principles and techniques.
